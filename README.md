# Video Player Component
---
Re-usable video player component using webpack. Basically, this is just a bower component packed using webpack.

# Pre-requisites
Clone and run `npm install && bower install`

# Development and Testing
Bower provides the same API with npm for developing and testing reusable components. To test this component locally without pushing new changes to the bower registry, execute the following command directly inside the player-component folder:

`bower link`

and then, in your application directory, run:

`bower link player-component`
